                                        All Megh Studio orders are presented in an iconic gift box in the distinctive shade
                                        "pale yellow-green". Playing with contrast, the boxes are accented by touches of
                                        brown, reminiscent of the Maison's ribbons and the historic color used for
                                        personalization from 2022. The chromatic harmony creates a timeless allure with a
                                        contemporary flair, in an ode to the golden age of travel.
